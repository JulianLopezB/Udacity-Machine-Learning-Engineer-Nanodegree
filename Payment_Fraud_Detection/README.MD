# Detecting Payment Card Fraud

This project takes in a credit card fraud detection dataset and uses a binary classification model to identify transactions as either fraudulent or valid, based on provided historical data. The built-in SageMaker algorithm, LinearLearner is used for 1) regression tasks in which a linear line is fit to some data points and you want to produce a predicted output value given some data point and for 2) binary classification, in which a line is separating two classes of data and effectively output labels; either 1 (fraudulent) for data that falls above the line or 0 (valid) for points that fall on or below the line.
